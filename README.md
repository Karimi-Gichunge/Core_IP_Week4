# Hypothesis Testing on Bluecar usage on different day types for Autolib Electric Carsharing 

# Research Question
To investigate whether there is a significant difference between Bluecar usage on different day types, i.e weekdays or weekends.

# Context:
Autolib' is an electric car sharing service which based in Paris, France. It is operated by the Bolloré industrial group. The Autolib' scheme maintains a fleet of all-electric Bolloré Bluecars for public use on a paid subscription basis, employing a citywide network of parking and charging stations.The company has over 3,980 Bluecars registered for the service, and the scheme has more than 126,900 registered subscribers.  Autolib' furthermore offers more than 1,084 electric car station points.

To enable the company to make more customer based decisions a study is undertaken to study 
Which day types have a greater number of bluecars taken from stations, is it weekdays or weekends? 
Also, the study will try to answer whether there is a substantial difference between the number of bluecars taken from different stations.
Note: 
Weekdays are days from Monday to Friday
Weekends is Saturday and Sunday

# Claim:
The Autolib car sharing company claims that the number of blue cars  taken during the weekend is different to the one taken during the weekdays.
During this study we will be analyzing, visualizing and manipulating data provided by the  Autolib car sharing company concerning the daily usage of bluecars between January and June 2018. We will be mostly interested in the daily summation of blue cars taken from different stations for every day of the week.

We will be using a paired sample t-test for mean since our data is from the same group but from different times of the week.

# Hypothesis:
We are going to test the hypothesis that the number of blue cars  taken during the weekends is similar to the one taken during the weekdays against the alternative hypothesis that  the number of blue cars  taken during the weekends varies from the one taken during the weekdays.
Key:
mu₁: mean of bluecars taken during normal weekdays 

mu₂: mean of bluecars taken during the weekends

Ho: mu₁ = mu₂.

H1: mu₁ != mu₂



This study contains a python notebook and a hypothesis report.
